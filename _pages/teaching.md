<p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
   As the development of the Internet and IT technology, short-text based communication is so popular compared with voice based one.
   Chat-based communication enables rapid, short and massive exchange of message with many people, creates new social problems.
   ‘Cross-texting’ is one of them.
   It refers to accidentally sending a text to an unintended person during the concurrent conversations with separated multiple people.
   Cross-texting would be a serious problem in languages where respectful expressions are required.
   As text-based communication is getting popular, it is a crucial work to prevent cross-texting by detecting it in advance in languages with honorifics expression such as Korean.
   In this paper, we proposed two methods detecting a cross-text using a deep learning model.
   The first model is the formal feature vector, which models dialog by explicitly defining the politeness and completeness features.
   The second one is the grpah2vec based ChatGram-net model, which models the dialog based on the syllable occurrence relationship.
   To evaluate the detection performance, we suggest a generating method for cross-text datasets from a actual messenger corpus.
   In experiment we show that both detecting models detected cross-text effectively, and exceeded the performance of the baseline models.
